External metadata Installation and configuration
Juan Pablo Fernandez Ramirez.

Instructions provided here are additional steps to the ones provided on:

1. INSTALL.txt
2. INSTALL_DOI.txt

This file provides information about how to install, configure and use the
external metadata database, and how it is use within the application.

1. Install the SQL database.

   Refer to the Install the SQL databases in INSTALL.txt
   
2. Download external metadata files.

   For CiteSeerX:
   
   a. dblp metadata: download the dblp.xml and dblp.dtd files (http://dblp.uni-trier.de/xml/).
   b. CiteULike: the linkouts file (http://www.citeulike.org/faq/data.adp)
   
3. Configure your application

   Edit conf/csx.properties to provide adequate values for:
   
   a. The external metadata database
   b. The location of the down loaded files (dblp.xml, dblp.dtd, linkouts)
   c. Labels: You can change the values for the labels. However, if you do so,
      you need also to change the values in the link_types table inside your
      citeseerx database to match the ones in csx.propierties file.
      
4. Populate/update the external database

   The database can be populated and/or updated by running:
   
   ./updateExternalMetadata
   
   The DBLP metadata is completed loaded into the database. However, from 
   CiteULike only CiteSeerX related records are loaded.
   
5. How to use the external metadata database

   Currently, the external metadata is used to create links to DBLP and CiteULike
   from the summary pages of documents within CiteSeerX corpus. In the future,
   DBLP data will be used to do automatic corrections and other task that will
   improve CiteSeerX corpus.
   
   Links to external sources are stored in two tables within the CiteSeerX
   database:
   
   * links_types: which stores the label, and the base URL where the link should
     points to.
   * elinks: which stores the CiteSeerX paper id, the label associated to the
     link, and the URL portion that needs to be appended to the base URL to 
     point to the resource in the external site.
     
     An example, of records in this two tables will be:
     
     DBLP, http://www.informatik.uni-trier.de/~ley/ and
     10.1.1.1.1485 DBLP db/conf/dsn/dsn2000.html#BondavalliMCFPS00
     
   The elink table is populated either by:
   
   a. Running the ./updateExternalLinks script. 
   
      This script will try to find matches for every document in the CiteSeerX
      corpus which does not have any match. It works for both CiteULike and DBLP.
      
      Indeed, The only way to create links for CiteULike is using this script.
      
   b. After a correction is done.
   
      The DBLP linker listen for changes in documents metadata. After a change 
      is reported, the Linker tries to find a math between the corrected 
      document and a record in DBLP.
