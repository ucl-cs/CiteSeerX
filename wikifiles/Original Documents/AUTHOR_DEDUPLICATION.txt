Author deduplication configuration
Juan Pablo Fernandez Ramirez.

We have notice that our extractors some times extracts and creates more than 
once record for the same author within a paper. While we work to improve our
extractor in order to minimize this issue, we also provide a program that will
eliminate duplicate author records associated to a paper. Here we explain how to
configure and run the process.

1. Configure your application.

   Edit conf/csx.properties to provide adequate values for:
   
   a. name.model: Location to the name model file. (it's provided within the 
   code, and it's located on: WEB-INF/resources/metric-distance/names.model)
   
2. Deduplicate Entries.

   To deduplicate entries in the database you can:
   
   a. Run the ./correctAuthors script
   b. Setup the job to run the author de-duplication job (See INSTALL.txt jobs)
      If you have more than one web application, for example in a cluster, be
      sure of configure the job only in one of the machines!
